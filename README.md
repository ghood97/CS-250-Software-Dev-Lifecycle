# CS-250-Software-Dev-Lifecycle

By using test cases and user stories, I was able to interpret the user's needs into technical requirements for this project. User stories helps to give some perspective on the requirements and gives them context. My approach to developing software is incremental. I write code in small increments and test them often. This is something that I try to incorporate into my career as well. A good team member is one who is collaborative, supportive, and self-sufficient.
